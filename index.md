### **Mechanical & Aerospace Engineer | EIT | Private Pilot**

As a recent Mechanical Engineering graduate with a minor in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Calgary, I‚Äôm driven by a deep commitment to the aerospace industry and innovation in mechanical design.

During my studies, I gained hands-on experience in the oil and gas sector at Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNRL), where I contributed to production optimization and project coordination.

Additionally, my involvement in the Student Organization for Aerospace Research (SOAR) provided me with a unique platform to apply aerospace concepts in practical, interdisciplinary projects.
