#  Aerospace & Mechanical Projects

Below are selected aerospace and mechanical projects I've completed using tools such as ANSYS, OpenFOAM, SolidWorks, and Python.

---

###  [FEA Analysis of Cessna 172 Wing](/new-portfolio/projects/cessna-fea.html)
- Structural analysis using FEA to evaluate deformation, stress, and vibration on a simplified wing under real flight conditions.
- Integrated CFD loads from 2D steady-state simulations to model climb and cruise performance.

---

###  [Aircraft Design](/new-portfolio/projects/aircraft-design.html)
- Designed and validated a lightweight RC aircraft using SolidWorks and XFLR5 simulations.
- Achieved stable, controlled flight with <250g takeoff weight and aerodynamic optimization.

###  [Thrust Vector Control (TVC) â€“ Capstone Project](/new-portfolio/projects/tvc-capstone.html)
- Developed and hot-fire tested a jet vane TVC system with integrated vertical stand and instrumentation.
- Awarded ðŸ¥‡ First Place in the Multidisciplinary Engineering Category at the Engineering Design Fair.

---

###  [TVC Feasibility Study â€“ SOAR Rocket](/new-portfolio/projects/tvc-study.html)
- Compared fin vs TVC stability for a 10,000 ft solid rocket using OpenRocket simulations.
- Recommended jet vane TVC with EMA actuators for improved altitude performance and control.

---

###  [Scramjet CFD Simulation](/new-portfolio/projects/scramjet-cfd.html)
- Combined Python-based 1D modeling with OpenFOAM CFD to analyze scramjet performance.
- Assessed thrust, TSFC, and combustion efficiency across varying Mach numbers and equivalence ratios.

---

###  [CFD: Unsteady Flow Over Cylinder](/new-portfolio/projects/cylinder-cfd.html)
- Simulated 2D vortex shedding using OpenFOAM and validated Strouhal number with Roshkoâ€™s data.
- Conducted grid convergence study and visualized vortex dynamics with ParaView.

---

###  [Radiant In-Floor Heating System](/new-portfolio/projects/infloor-heating.html)
- Designed a radiant glycol-based heating system for a âˆ’45Â°C environment using heat transfer analysis.
- Delivered full CAD layout, flow loop design, and energy calculations for a 2400 ftÂ² garage.
