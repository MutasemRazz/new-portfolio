# ✈️ Aerospace & Mechanical Projects

Below are selected aerospace and mechanical projects I've completed using tools such as ANSYS, OpenFOAM, and SolidWorks.

---

### 🛠️ [FEA Analysis of Cessna 172 Wing](/projects/cessna-wing-fea.html)
- Structural analysis using FEA to evaluate deformation, stress, and vibration on a simplified wing under real flight conditions.
- Integrated CFD loads from 2D steady-state simulations to model climb and cruise performance.

---

### 🚀 [Thrust Vector Control System – Capstone Project](/projects/tvc-capstone.html)
- Designed and optimized a jet-vane thrust vector control system.
- Performed FEA on test stand and TVC parts, and validated system via hot-fire tests.

---

### 🔥 [Scramjet CFD Analysis](/projects/scramjet-cfd.html)
- Conducted compressible flow simulations of scramjet geometry using OpenFOAM.
- Analyzed shock structures and combustion zone behavior.
