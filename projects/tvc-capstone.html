  </p>

  <h3>✅ Objectives</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Develop a cost-effective Thrust Vector Control (TVC) system using a jet vane mechanism for solid rocket motors.</li>
    <li>Design and fabricate a vertical test stand with integrated instrumentation for ground validation.</li>
    <li>Execute hot fire tests to validate the mechanical and software integration of the TVC system.</li>
    <li>Provide the SOAR rocketry team with a proven baseline system for future flight implementation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>📊 Key Results</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>4 successful hot fire tests conducted with full TVC actuation and real-time control.</li>
    <li>Jet vane TVC system integrated with load cells, servos, microcontroller-based PID loop, and thrust measurement system.</li>
    <li>Vertical test stand passed FEA safety checks under expected thrust loads (~200 N).</li>
    <li>T-slot aluminum framing selected for modularity and precision, improving adaptability for future tests.</li>
    <li>Real-time data acquired from load cells confirmed system responsiveness and control accuracy.</li>
  </ul>
