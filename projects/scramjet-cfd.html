  <h2>🔥 Scramjet CFD Analysis</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Course:</strong> Aircraft & Rocket Propulsion<br>
    <strong>Role:</strong> CFD Analyst<br>
    <strong>Tools:</strong> OpenFOAM, ParaView, MATLAB, VisIt
  </p>

  <h3>✅ Objectives</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Perform CFD simulation of compressible flow through a scramjet combustion chamber using OpenFOAM.</li>
    <li>Analyze shock wave interactions and combustion zone behavior at supersonic speeds.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>📊 Key Results</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Simulation captured shock trains and shock-boundary layer interaction in supersonic regime.</li>
    <li>Observed combustion zone stabilization and thermal boundary layer development.</li>
    <li>Used residual convergence analysis to validate steady-state conditions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🛠️ Your Contributions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Built custom 2D geometry and mesh using blockMesh for scramjet inlet and combustor section.</li>
    <li>Implemented turbulence and compressibility models using rhoCentralFoam solver.</li>
    <li>Post-processed results using ParaView to visualize shock structures and Mach contours.</li>
    <li>Prepared simulation report comparing different shock structures under varied inflow Mach numbers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>📦 Deliverables</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Fully meshed scramjet geometry with CFD setup and boundary conditions.</li>
    <li>Mach number contour plots and pressure distribution results.</li>
    <li>Simulation report including analysis of boundary layers, stagnation pressure loss, and shock positioning.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🎥 Media (Recommended)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Contour visualizations of Mach number and pressure using ParaView</li>
    <li>Comparison of inlet vs exit profiles under different inflow speeds</li>
    <li>Animated shock propagation across combustion section</li>
  </ul>
