# ‚úàÔ∏è Aircraft Design ‚Äì Jet Trainer Aircraft  
Course: ENME 485 ‚Äì Aircraft Design (Fall 2023)  
Role: Structural & Aerodynamic Designer | Tools: MATLAB, AVL, SolidWorks  

---

## ‚úÖ Objectives  
Design a high-performance military jet trainer aircraft from conceptual layout to detailed design phase.  

Analyze:  
- Mission profile optimization and payload estimation  
- Wing loading, thrust-to-weight calculations  
- Airfoil selection, empennage design, and aerodynamic surfaces  
- Initial weight breakdown and stability margins  
- Component layout using CAD and aerodynamic validation with AVL  

---

## üìä Key Results  
- Takeoff Weight: 4,241 lbs  
- Max Mach: 0.79 (at 20,000 ft)  
- Thrust-to-weight ratio: 0.51  
- Wing loading: 64.6 lb/ft¬≤  
- Trimmed for neutral stability margin at cruise conditions  
- Used NACA 64A010 and NACA 0008 profiles for main wing and tail  

---

## üì¶ Deliverables  
- Mission profile plot with altitude/speed segments  
- Mass breakdown table and center of gravity analysis  
- Aerodynamic surface sizing (wing, elevator, rudder)  
- AVL simulation results for static stability  
- CAD model of the aircraft layout with cockpit, engine, and landing gear
