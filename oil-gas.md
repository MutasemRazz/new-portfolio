### Key Projects

#### • Mixed Cross-Linking Agents Trials  
Collaborated with lab and field teams to develop and analyze a lightweight polymer-crosslinker mixture to prevent wellbore gelation and reduce downtime. Improved job efficiency and production outcomes.

#### • South Brintnell Battery Consolidation  
Managed the consolidation of South Brintnell Battery, achieving an estimated $6.5 million annual OPEX savings by the end of 2024. Demonstrated capabilities in operational cost reduction and project management through collaboration with multidisciplinary teams.

#### • Tracer Study 
Identified and resolved Extreme breakthrough issues in 7 producer wells in South Brintnell by leading a tracer study with a third-party company. Increased production by 64 bbl/d. 

#### • Break-through Innovative Solution 
Proposed an innovative and cost-effective solution to remedy the communication breakdown between a producer and multiple injectors by focusing on rectifying the issue at the producer's end rather than conducting cross-linker operations on multiple injectors, resulting in a 5x reduction in costs and enhanced overall effectiveness. 

#### • West Brintnell Gas Conservation  
Oversaw a project to capture 37.9 e3m3/month of venting gas, collaborating with facilities engineers to assess expansions and integrate gas into existing pipelines. Successfully earned credits, reduced emissions, and gained hands-on experience in greenhouse gas emissions accounting and environmental stewardship. 

#### • Pelican Battery Boiler Optimization  
Conducted year-round dynamic fuel/air intake analysis on four boilers, collaborating with third-party consultants to enhance efficiency and reduce fuel costs through actionable recommendations.

#### • Well Maintenance Operations  
Managed 63 well maintenance projects, providing crucial technical support for data analysis. Resulted in a production increase of 502.9 bbl/d or $7.3 million annually, showcasing problem-solving and results-oriented capabilities.
